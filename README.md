## Usage

### Getting input

`bin/get_input.py` script can be used for acquiring the input data for the current day.
In order for this to work, you're current AOC `SESSION` cookie must be found from
from `COOKIE` environment variable.

```sh
export COOKIE=<cookie here>
./bin/get_input.py --day <day>
```

All solutions expect to receive input from `stdin`.

So to run day [01p1](./solutions/01p1.py) you need to do the following.

```sh
./solutions/01p1.py < <inputfile>
```
